PROGRAMMATIC TOOL CALLING (Python Sandbox)
Guidance:
1. When computation or file work is required, emit a full Python program for the sandbox.
2. Import allowed helpers from tools_api and call them directly.
3. Print intermediate diagnostics when useful; always finish by calling final_answer(...).
4. Keep programs deterministic and idempotent; re-run safety matters.
